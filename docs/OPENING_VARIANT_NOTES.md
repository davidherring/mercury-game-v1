## Dev Note: BRA Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

Brazil’s Top Secret constraints emphasize development sensitivity, regional context, and the centrality of artisanal and small-scale gold mining, while still allowing meaningful variation in **framing, coalition strategy, and moral emphasis**. The four BRA variants represent different but credible diplomatic personas that shape how Brazil engages with ambition, equity, and implementation.

  **Use when:** You want coalition politics and regional frameworks to drive progress

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Support for international cooperation is preserved**
* **Firmness varies to reflect development priorities and leadership posture**

The variants do not change Brazil’s fundamental interests. They change **how Brazil weighs ambition against feasibility**, and **whether progress flows through ecosystems, livelihoods, or regional leadership**.

This preserves realism while enabling distinct negotiation arcs and replayability.

---

## Dev Note: CAN Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

Canada’s Top Secret constraints emphasize evidence-based policy, credibility through implementation, and attention to long-range impacts. Within that envelope, the four CAN variants explore different ways Canada can exercise influence through **science, equity, facilitation, and technical credibility**.

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Core support for international action remains consistent**
* **Issue preferences do not change**
* **Firmness varies to reflect posture, not substance**

The variants do not change what Canada supports. They change **how Canada exerts influence**, and **whether progress flows through evidence, equity, facilitation, or implementation**.

This preserves realism while enabling distinct negotiation arcs and replayability.

---

## Dev Note: CHN Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

China’s Top Secret constraints produce a narrow policy envelope but allow meaningful variation in **tone, emphasis, and negotiation strategy**. The four CHN variants represent different diplomatic personas that are all valid under the same national position. Swapping variants changes coalition dynamics, Round 2 conversations, and perceived legitimacy, even when final vote preferences remain similar.

  **Use when:** You want economic realism to dominate and science arguments to be contested indirectly

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Red lines do not change**
* **Firmness varies within a controlled range**

The variants are not about changing China’s position. They are about changing **how difficult it is to negotiate with China**, and **what kind of negotiation is required** to make progress.

This ensures replayability without breaking realism or balance.

---

## Dev Note: EU Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

The European Union’s Top Secret constraints establish a strong commitment to precautionary action on mercury while allowing variation in **how ambition is expressed, justified, and pursued**.

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Preferred outcomes remain aligned**

This maintains realism while allowing distinct negotiation dynamics and replayability.

---

## Dev Note: USA Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

The United States’ Top Secret constraints define a clear commitment to international action while allowing variation in **tone, framing, and leadership posture**. The four USA variants represent distinct diplomatic personas that all support coordinated action, but differ in how they justify, pace, and operationalize it. Variant selection shapes coalition patterns, Round 2 agenda-setting, and perceptions of credibility, even when preferred votes align.

## Dev Note: TZA Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

Tanzania’s Top Secret constraints emphasize immediate human exposure, development realities, and the central role of artisanal and small-scale gold mining.

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Primary focus on ASGM-related exposure remains consistent**
* **Support for international cooperation is preserved**
* **Firmness varies to reflect framing, not core interests**

The variants do not change Tanzania’s priorities. They change **how Tanzania applies pressure**, and **whether progress flows through health urgency, regional coordination, or coalition politics**.

This ensures replayability while maintaining realism and respect for development constraints.

This supports replayability while maintaining realism and strategic coherence.

---

## Dev Note: AMAP Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

AMAP’s Top Secret constraints define it as a **non-voting scientific authority** whose influence comes from credibility, framing, and persistence rather than bargaining power.

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **AMAP does not advocate national positions**
* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Influence is exerted through framing, not voting**

The variants are not about changing the science. They are about changing **how science enters the room**: as background context, warning signal, constraint on overreach, or test of real-world effectiveness.

This preserves AMAP’s institutional realism while giving science multiple, meaningful roles in gameplay.

---

## Dev Note: MFF Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

Mercury Free Future’s Top Secret constraints define it as a **normative, advocacy-driven NGO** whose influence comes from moral pressure, clarity of direction, and insistence on outcomes rather than compromise.

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Support for mercury elimination remains constant**
* **Firmness increases through framing, not issue preference changes**
* **Influence is exerted through pressure, not negotiation**

The variants do not change what MFF wants. They change **how MFF applies leverage**, and **which weaknesses in the negotiation are made visible**.

This preserves advocacy realism while creating distinct gameplay arcs driven by moral authority, norms, or accountability.

---

## Dev Note: WCPA Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

WCPA’s Top Secret constraints position it as an **industry advocate focused on feasibility, cost, and system stability** rather than denial of environmental harm. The four WCPA variants explore different ways industry influence can shape negotiations without voting power. Variant choice affects whether WCPA slows ambition, redirects it through technology, or reframes risk around energy security.

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Recognition of mercury risk remains intact**
* **Opposition targets methods, not goals**
* **Firmness increases with perceived system threat**

The variants do not change WCPA’s interests. They change **how WCPA defines risk**, and **which tradeoffs delegates must confront**.

This preserves industry realism while ensuring WCPA plays an active, consequential role in shaping outcomes.
