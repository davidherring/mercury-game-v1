## Dev Note: CHN Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

China’s Top Secret constraints produce a narrow policy envelope but allow meaningful variation in **tone, emphasis, and negotiation strategy**. The four CHN variants represent different diplomatic personas that are all valid under the same national position. Swapping variants changes coalition dynamics, Round 2 conversations, and perceived legitimacy, even when final vote preferences remain similar.

### CHN_baseline_v1 — *Hardline Power Framer*

**Style:** Assertive, confrontational, norm-challenging
**Core move:** Directly contests scientific sufficiency and fairness, pressures developed countries
**Gameplay effect:**

* Raises early tension in Round 1
* Polarizes EU/USA quickly
* Pushes China toward defensive or oppositional coalitions
  **Use when:** You want sharper conflict, faster polarization, and clearer ideological lines

---

### CHN_calibrated_pragmatist_v2 — *Senior Technocrat*

**Style:** Measured, procedural, evidence-focused
**Core move:** Slows momentum by emphasizing uncertainty and process discipline
**Gameplay effect:**

* Extends debate into technical terrain
* Encourages science-heavy Round 2 conversations
* Makes China appear reasonable without conceding substance
  **Use when:** You want longer negotiations and a slower, more analytical game arc

---

### CHN_coalition_builder_v3 — *Equity-Focused Diplomat*

**Style:** Inclusive, strategic, quietly defensive
**Core move:** Aligns with developing countries around fairness and capacity
**Gameplay effect:**

* Builds South-South coalitions early
* Isolates EU/USA without open confrontation
* Shifts pressure toward equity and assistance mechanisms
  **Use when:** You want bloc politics, coalition formation, and indirect leverage

---

### CHN_national_realist_v4 — *Economic Sovereignty Advocate*

**Style:** Confident, cost-focused, domestically grounded
**Core move:** Frames China as already acting and resistant to external mandates
**Gameplay effect:**

* Reframes debate around feasibility and timelines
* Makes binding proposals appear impractical
* Forces other players to justify enforcement and cost assumptions
  **Use when:** You want economic realism to dominate and science arguments to be contested indirectly

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Red lines do not change**
* **Firmness varies within a controlled range**

The variants are not about changing China’s position. They are about changing **how difficult it is to negotiate with China**, and **what kind of negotiation is required** to make progress.

This ensures replayability without breaking realism or balance.
