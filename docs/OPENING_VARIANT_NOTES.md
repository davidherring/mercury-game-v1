## Dev Note: CHN Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

China’s Top Secret constraints produce a narrow policy envelope but allow meaningful variation in **tone, emphasis, and negotiation strategy**. The four CHN variants represent different diplomatic personas that are all valid under the same national position. Swapping variants changes coalition dynamics, Round 2 conversations, and perceived legitimacy, even when final vote preferences remain similar.

### CHN_baseline_v1 — *Hardline Power Framer*

**Style:** Assertive, confrontational, norm-challenging
**Core move:** Directly contests scientific sufficiency and fairness, pressures developed countries
**Gameplay effect:**

* Raises early tension in Round 1
* Polarizes EU/USA quickly
* Pushes China toward defensive or oppositional coalitions
  **Use when:** You want sharper conflict, faster polarization, and clearer ideological lines

---

### CHN_calibrated_pragmatist_v2 — *Senior Technocrat*

**Style:** Measured, procedural, evidence-focused
**Core move:** Slows momentum by emphasizing uncertainty and process discipline
**Gameplay effect:**

* Extends debate into technical terrain
* Encourages science-heavy Round 2 conversations
* Makes China appear reasonable without conceding substance
  **Use when:** You want longer negotiations and a slower, more analytical game arc

---

### CHN_coalition_builder_v3 — *Equity-Focused Diplomat*

**Style:** Inclusive, strategic, quietly defensive
**Core move:** Aligns with developing countries around fairness and capacity
**Gameplay effect:**

* Builds South-South coalitions early
* Isolates EU/USA without open confrontation
* Shifts pressure toward equity and assistance mechanisms
  **Use when:** You want bloc politics, coalition formation, and indirect leverage

---

### CHN_national_realist_v4 — *Economic Sovereignty Advocate*

**Style:** Confident, cost-focused, domestically grounded
**Core move:** Frames China as already acting and resistant to external mandates
**Gameplay effect:**

* Reframes debate around feasibility and timelines
* Makes binding proposals appear impractical
* Forces other players to justify enforcement and cost assumptions
  **Use when:** You want economic realism to dominate and science arguments to be contested indirectly

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Red lines do not change**
* **Firmness varies within a controlled range**

The variants are not about changing China’s position. They are about changing **how difficult it is to negotiate with China**, and **what kind of negotiation is required** to make progress.

This ensures replayability without breaking realism or balance.

## Dev Note: EU Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

The European Union’s Top Secret constraints establish a strong commitment to precautionary action on mercury while allowing variation in **how ambition is expressed, justified, and pursued**. The four EU variants represent distinct diplomatic personas that differ in emphasis on values, governance, urgency, and coalition maintenance. Variant choice shapes pacing, coalition stability, and whether negotiations trend toward convergence or pressure.

### EU_baseline_v1 — *Science-Led Multilateral Advocate*

**Style:** Confident, analytical, consensus-oriented
**Core move:** Frames mercury as a shared scientific problem requiring coordinated international response
**Gameplay effect:**

* Aligns naturally with USA leadership variants
* Applies steady pressure toward binding cooperation
* Establishes EU as a credibility anchor early in Round 1
  **Use when:** You want clear scientific framing and steady momentum toward formal action

---

### EU_regulatory_steward_v2 — *Legal and Institutional Architect*

**Style:** Procedural, governance-focused, disciplined
**Core move:** Emphasizes regulatory coherence, enforceability, and legal integration
**Gameplay effect:**

* Shifts debate toward framework design and compliance
* Rewards detailed Round 2 discussions on mechanisms
* Slows ideological escalation without lowering ambition
  **Use when:** You want negotiations to hinge on institutional soundness rather than urgency

---

### EU_precautionary_leader_v3 — *Values-Driven Risk Preventer*

**Style:** Normative, health-focused, forward-leaning
**Core move:** Centers human and ecological protection and argues for early action despite uncertainty
**Gameplay effect:**

* Raises moral and preventive pressure on hesitant actors
* Tightens alignment with NGOs and science-forward players
* Increases tension with sovereignty-focused states
  **Use when:** You want urgency, ethical framing, and sharper pressure toward strong commitments

---

### EU_consensus_bridge_v4 — *Coalition Maintainer*

**Style:** Pragmatic, inclusive, patient
**Core move:** Prioritizes broad participation and incremental convergence over immediate ambition
**Gameplay effect:**

* Reduces risk of deadlock or walk-outs
* Keeps major emitters engaged longer
* Delays binding outcomes in favor of trust-building
  **Use when:** You want stability, gradual progress, and sustained multilateral engagement

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Preferred outcomes remain aligned**
* **Commitment to coordinated action is preserved**
* **Firmness varies to reflect diplomatic posture and pacing**

The variants do not change what the European Union supports. They change **how the EU applies pressure**, and **whether progress comes through urgency, structure, values, or inclusion**.

This maintains realism while allowing distinct negotiation dynamics and replayability.

## Dev Note: USA Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

The United States’ Top Secret constraints define a clear commitment to international action while allowing variation in **tone, framing, and leadership posture**. The four USA variants represent distinct diplomatic personas that all support coordinated action, but differ in how they justify, pace, and operationalize it. Variant selection shapes coalition patterns, Round 2 agenda-setting, and perceptions of credibility, even when preferred votes align.

### USA_baseline_v1 — *Confident Multilateral Leader*

**Style:** Direct, confident, science-forward
**Core move:** Frames mercury as a shared global problem that requires structured international action
**Gameplay effect:**

* Establishes early momentum toward binding cooperation

  **Use when:** You want clear leadership signals and faster convergence toward formal action

---

### USA_institutional_pragmatist_v2 — *Governance Architect*

**Style:** Procedural, measured, implementation-focused
**Core move:** Emphasizes credibility, accountability, and institutional design over urgency
**Gameplay effect:**

* Shifts debate toward mechanisms and compliance
* Encourages detailed Round 2 discussions on reporting and sequencing
* Reduces ideological tension without weakening outcomes
  **Use when:** You want longer, more technical negotiations focused on how agreements work

---

### USA_domestic_realist_v3 — *Durability-Constrained Negotiator*

**Style:** Cautious, grounded, politically aware
**Core move:** Centers domestic feasibility and long-term sustainability of commitments
**Gameplay effect:**

**Core move:** Sets direction by proposing shared goals and practical pathways
**Gameplay effect:**

* Encourages broad coalitions around framework design
* Positions the USA as a bridge between ambition and flexibility
* Accelerates discussions about early wins and capacity building
  **Use when:** You want proactive agenda-setting and visible progress without overt pressure

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Support for coordinated international action is preserved**
* **Firmness varies to reflect leadership posture and constraints**

The variants do not change what the United States wants. They change **how the United States leads**, and **what kind of cooperation other players must engage in** to reach agreement.

This supports replayability while maintaining realism and strategic coherence.
