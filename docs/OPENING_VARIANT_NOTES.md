## Dev Note: CHN Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

China’s Top Secret constraints produce a narrow policy envelope but allow meaningful variation in **tone, emphasis, and negotiation strategy**. The four CHN variants represent different diplomatic personas that are all valid under the same national position. Swapping variants changes coalition dynamics, Round 2 conversations, and perceived legitimacy, even when final vote preferences remain similar.

### CHN_baseline_v1 — *Hardline Power Framer*

**Style:** Assertive, confrontational, norm-challenging
**Core move:** Directly contests scientific sufficiency and fairness, pressures developed countries
**Gameplay effect:**

* Raises early tension in Round 1
* Polarizes EU/USA quickly
* Pushes China toward defensive or oppositional coalitions
  **Use when:** You want sharper conflict, faster polarization, and clearer ideological lines

---

### CHN_calibrated_pragmatist_v2 — *Senior Technocrat*

**Style:** Measured, procedural, evidence-focused
**Core move:** Slows momentum by emphasizing uncertainty and process discipline
**Gameplay effect:**

* Extends debate into technical terrain
* Encourages science-heavy Round 2 conversations
* Makes China appear reasonable without conceding substance
  **Use when:** You want longer negotiations and a slower, more analytical game arc

---

### CHN_coalition_builder_v3 — *Equity-Focused Diplomat*

**Style:** Inclusive, strategic, quietly defensive
**Core move:** Aligns with developing countries around fairness and capacity
**Gameplay effect:**

* Builds South-South coalitions early
* Isolates EU/USA without open confrontation
* Shifts pressure toward equity and assistance mechanisms
  **Use when:** You want bloc politics, coalition formation, and indirect leverage

---

### CHN_national_realist_v4 — *Economic Sovereignty Advocate*

**Style:** Confident, cost-focused, domestically grounded
**Core move:** Frames China as already acting and resistant to external mandates
**Gameplay effect:**

* Reframes debate around feasibility and timelines
* Makes binding proposals appear impractical
* Forces other players to justify enforcement and cost assumptions
  **Use when:** You want economic realism to dominate and science arguments to be contested indirectly

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Red lines do not change**
* **Firmness varies within a controlled range**

The variants are not about changing China’s position. They are about changing **how difficult it is to negotiate with China**, and **what kind of negotiation is required** to make progress.

This ensures replayability without breaking realism or balance.

## Dev Note: USA Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

The United States’ Top Secret constraints define a clear commitment to international action while allowing variation in **tone, framing, and leadership posture**. The four USA variants represent distinct diplomatic personas that all support coordinated action, but differ in how they justify, pace, and operationalize it. Variant selection shapes coalition patterns, Round 2 agenda-setting, and perceptions of credibility, even when preferred votes align.

### USA_baseline_v1 — *Confident Multilateral Leader*

**Style:** Direct, confident, science-forward
**Core move:** Frames mercury as a shared global problem that requires structured international action
**Gameplay effect:**

* Establishes early momentum toward binding cooperation
* Aligns quickly with EU-style positions
* Puts pressure on reluctant parties to justify delay
  **Use when:** You want clear leadership signals and faster convergence toward formal action

---

### USA_institutional_pragmatist_v2 — *Governance Architect*

**Style:** Procedural, measured, implementation-focused
**Core move:** Emphasizes credibility, accountability, and institutional design over urgency
**Gameplay effect:**

* Shifts debate toward mechanisms and compliance
* Encourages detailed Round 2 discussions on reporting and sequencing
* Reduces ideological tension without weakening outcomes
  **Use when:** You want longer, more technical negotiations focused on how agreements work

---

### USA_domestic_realist_v3 — *Durability-Constrained Negotiator*

**Style:** Cautious, grounded, politically aware
**Core move:** Centers domestic feasibility and long-term sustainability of commitments
**Gameplay effect:**

* Slows escalation toward rigid obligations
* Creates space for compromise with China and swing states
* Forces EU and NGOs to address political constraints explicitly
  **Use when:** You want feasibility and longevity to dominate the negotiation logic

---

### USA_agenda_setter_v4 — *Forward-Looking Coalition Builder*

**Style:** Optimistic, strategic, outward-facing
**Core move:** Sets direction by proposing shared goals and practical pathways
**Gameplay effect:**

* Encourages broad coalitions around framework design
* Positions the USA as a bridge between ambition and flexibility
* Accelerates discussions about early wins and capacity building
  **Use when:** You want proactive agenda-setting and visible progress without overt pressure

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Support for coordinated international action is preserved**
* **Firmness varies to reflect leadership posture and constraints**

The variants do not change what the United States wants. They change **how the United States leads**, and **what kind of cooperation other players must engage in** to reach agreement.

This supports replayability while maintaining realism and strategic coherence.
