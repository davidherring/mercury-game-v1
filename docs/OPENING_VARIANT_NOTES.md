## Dev Note: BRA Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

Brazil’s Top Secret constraints emphasize development sensitivity, regional context, and the centrality of artisanal and small-scale gold mining, while still allowing meaningful variation in **framing, coalition strategy, and moral emphasis**. The four BRA variants represent different but credible diplomatic personas that shape how Brazil engages with ambition, equity, and implementation.

**Core move:** Centers livelihoods and informal economies in mercury policy
**Gameplay effect:**

* Slows movement toward restrictive measures

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Support for international cooperation is preserved**
* **Firmness varies to reflect development priorities and leadership posture**

The variants do not change Brazil’s fundamental interests. They change **how Brazil weighs ambition against feasibility**, and **whether progress flows through ecosystems, livelihoods, or regional leadership**.

This preserves realism while enabling distinct negotiation arcs and replayability.

## Dev Note: CAN Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

Canada’s Top Secret constraints emphasize evidence-based policy, credibility through implementation, and attention to long-range impacts.

The variants do not change what Canada supports. They change **how Canada exerts influence**, and **whether progress flows through evidence, equity, facilitation, or implementation**.

This preserves realism while enabling distinct negotiation arcs and replayability.

---

## Dev Note: CHN Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

China’s Top Secret constraints produce a narrow policy envelope but allow meaningful variation in **tone, emphasis, and negotiation strategy**. The four CHN variants represent different diplomatic personas that are all valid under the same national position.

---

### Design Principle

Across all variants:

* **Issue preferences remain consistent**
* **Red lines do not change**

The variants are not about changing China’s position. They are about changing **how difficult it is to negotiate with China**, and **what kind of negotiation is required** to make progress.

This ensures replayability without breaking realism or balance.

---

## Dev Note: EU Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

## Dev Note: USA Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

The United States’ Top Secret constraints define a clear commitment to international action while allowing variation in **tone, framing, and leadership posture**. The four USA variants represent distinct diplomatic personas that all support coordinated action, but differ in how they justify, pace, and operationalize it. Variant selection shapes coalition patterns, Round 2 agenda-setting, and perceptions of credibility, even when preferred votes align.

## Dev Note: TZA Opening Variants (Design Rationale)

Tanzania’s Top Secret constraints emphasize immediate human exposure, development realities, and the central role of artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Within that envelope, the four TZA variants explore different ways Tanzania can exercise influence through **regional coordination, health framing, and equity-based coalition building**. Variant choice shapes whether Tanzania acts primarily as a local-impact advocate or a broader developing-country voice.

### Design Principle

Across all variants:
